The following configuration options are available:

### Experience Cloud Organization ID

The ID for your Experience Cloud Organization.

Your ID is a 24-character, alphanumeric string followed by @AdobeOrg. If you do not know this ID, contact Customer Care.

### Exclude specific paths

The Experience Cloud ID does not load if the URL matches any of the specified paths.

\(Optional\) Enable Regex if this is a regular expression.

Click Add to exclude another path.

### Opt In

Use the Opt-In options to determine whether or not to create cookies on a visitor's computer or device. If enabled, Opt-In waits for consent to track a visitor's activities on your website.

There are three options:

* **doesOptInApply=False:** Does not wait for consent to track the visitor
* **doesOptInApply=True:** Waits for consent to track the visitor
* **doesOptInApply=Callback:** Sets Opt-In to a function that resolves to a Boolean, after it does some calculations. If you select Callback, the Select Data Element field becomes available. Select the desired data element. For example, Opt-In can parse the website URL to see if itâ€™s located in the EU. In this example, select a data element that contains your country.

### Variables

Set name-value pairs as Experience Cloud ID instance properties. Use the drop-down to select a variable, then type or select a value. For information about each variable, refer to the [Experience Cloud ID Service documentation](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/mcvid/mcvid-overview.html).
