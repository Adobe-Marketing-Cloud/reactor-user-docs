#### Exclude Specific Paths

If the URL matches any of the excluded paths, the extension is not loaded.

#### Use DIL Site Catalyst Module

The [SiteCatalyst module](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/aam/r_dil_sc_init.html) works with DIL to send Analytics tag elements to Audience Manager.

Use the Code Editor to configure the siteCatalyst.init file.

You can also create a note containing information about this configuration.

Enable the [Google Analytics module](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/aam/dil-google-universal-analytics.html).

#### DIL.create Initialization Properties

Add initialization properties used by [DIL.create](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/aam/r_dil_create.html) and the namespace subproperty for the [visitorService object](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/aam/r_dil_visitor_service.html). Two sample use cases are included in the code comments, in the Code Editor.
