# Events Dispatched by Lifecycle

## Lifecycle Data Content Response

This event is a response from the Lifecycle module to notify lifecycle context data in which a client/module might be interested. If a callback has been registered, this event can then be used to issue a callback to the user.

It will be generated by the Lifecycle module, when `lifecycleStart` API is called when a new session is started and it contains the lifecycle metrics as part of `lifecyclecontextdata` and previous session information. For more details about available metrics see [Lifecycle Metrics](../../../lifecycle/lifecycle-metrics.md)
