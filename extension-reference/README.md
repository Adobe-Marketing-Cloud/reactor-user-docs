# Extension Reference

This Extensions Reference describes the extensions provided by Adobe.

Use this reference to find information about the settings available in each extension.

**Important:** Adobe doesn't warranty the extensions from 3rd party developers, it's up to extension authors to choose a license and support process for their extensions. Many developers have chosen to post the source code of their extension packages on Github, where customers can review them at their convenience. You can view those at [https://github.com/Launch-Developers](https://github.com/Launch-Developers).

We will be adding documentation highlighting the functionality of each extension featured in the catalog in the very near future."
