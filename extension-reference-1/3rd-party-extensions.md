# Third-Party Extensions

**Important:** Adobe doesn't warranty the extensions from 3rd party developers, it's up to extension authors to choose a license and support process for their extensions. Many developers have chosen to post the source code of their extension packages on Github, where customers can review them at their convenience. You can view those at [https://github.com/Launch-Developers](https://github.com/Launch-Developers).
