# Managing Resources

Dynamic Tag Management was primarily designed to help you place tags and code on your web pages. Launch provides that capability, but enhances it with even more features:

* Collect any customer behavior based on select pages, or all pages
* Easily deploy web apps
* Browse, deploy, and activate the right marketing tool, such as a chat service, quickly and easily
* Share data across your teams so the right people have access to the right data, ensuring delivery of better experiences.

Launch provides a sophisticated but easy-to-use rule builder so you can customize extensions \(or even create your own\) and store your code in customized libraries. You can host your libraries yourself, or let Adobe do it for you.

* [**Extensions**](extensions.md)

  An extension is a packaged set of code that extends the Launch interface and the library functionality. Launch is the platform, and extensions are like apps that run on the platform.

* [**Data Elements**](data-elements.md)

  Data elements are the building blocks for your data dictionary \(or data map\). Use data elements to collect, organize, and deliver data across marketing and ad technology.

* [**Rules**](rules.md)

  Launch is a rule-based system. It looks for user interaction and associated data. When the criteria outlined in your rules are met, the rule triggers the extension, script, or HTML you identified.

* [**Delete Resources**](https://github.com/Aaronius/gitbooktest/tree/190c7c3dc0fbdc5a9ed48e7927383d3e9f032d78/managing-resources/delete.md)

  You can delete data elements, rules, and extensions.
