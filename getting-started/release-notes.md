# Release Notes

## May 24, 2018

### Features

#### Launch and DTM libraries are now live in China

The Launch and DTM libraries using Akamai are now available on CDN edge nodes in China.  This will result in much faster library load speeds for end users in China.

#### Improved error messages

The information contained in error messages has been improved and expanded throughout the API and UI.  This should be especially useful for build failures messages.

#### Add All Changes Button

We've changed the behavior of the Add All Changes button on the Edit Library page.  Previously, a resource was only considered "changed" until you had added it to a Library and saved it.  Now a resource will be considered "changed" until it has been published to the Production environment.

#### Adobe Privacy extension

The Adobe Privacy extension provides functionality for collecting and/or removing user IDs assigned to end users by Adobe solutions.

#### Launch Core extension: Value Comparison condition

The new Value Comparison condition Compares two values, using any of several available operators.  This replaces the functionality of several older conditions that are far too specific.

#### Launch Core extension: Frequency condition

This condition allows you to specify the number of times the condition should return true within a time period or event occurrence. Examples: 5 times per Day, 2 times per Visit.

### Features

#### Data Elements duration, "None" option

Data Elements now have a "None" duration option.  Newly created Data Elements default to this setting.

#### Link DTM Embed Code to Launch

When you link your DTM embed code to Launch, you can keep your DTM production embed code on a page, but serve Launch files there instead of DTM. See [Link DTM Embed Code to Launch](../administration/link-dtm-embed-code.md).

## March 6, 2018

### Enhancements

#### User interface changes

## February 1, 2018

### Features

#### Akamai Cache Control Headers

Cache control headers are now automatically set for libraries hosted on Akamai \(assets.adobedtm.com\). Previously, we did not set cache control headers for any files hosted on assets.adobedtm.com.

* Production builds: Cache control headers are set to 60 minutes
* Staging builds with "-staging" in the filename: Cache control headers are set to 0 minutes
* Dev builds with "-development" in the filename: Cache control headers are set to 0 minutes
* Launch Staging builds without "-staging" in the filename: The default of 60 minutes is inherited
* Launch Development builds without "-development" in the filename: The default of 60 minutes is inherited

Note: It is up to browsers to receive and respect the cache control headers. Some browsers might ignore them.

Important: Launch developers who do not have "-development" or "-staging" in their Environment embed codes need to re-create their Development and Staging environments to get the 0 cache control header. If you don't re-create the environments, you'll have the same 60-minute cache control as the production libraries.

## January 18, 2018

### Features

#### Rule Ordering

Events in rules can now be assigned an order. When an event is triggered, any rules that use that event are executed in the order defined. Lower numbers run first \(1 comes before 10\). See [Rule ordering](release-notes.md#rule-ordering) for more information.

#### Set Active Library

Set a new or existing library as your active library. When creating/editing rules, data elements, or extensions, you'll now have an option to save and build to your active library. This will immediately save your change to your library and execute a build. The status of the build can also be seen.

#### Multiple arguments in the logger

You can now pass actual objects to the log function and view them as objects in the browser console when using `_satellite.debug()`. This makes the Launch logger behave a lot more like console.log. To enable this change, there is no longer a persistent history attached to the `_satellite.debug()` function, so when you call it for the first time, you'll no longer see a history of past events. You will see any debug messages from that point forward.

## January 10, 2018

### Features

#### Asynchronous Deploy of Launch

* On-page

  The Launch library now includes support for running asynchronously. There are important ramifications for how this changes what happens in your library. You should read the [Async documentation](../client-side-information/asynchronous-deployment.md) before you do anything.

* Async Toggle on Environments

  When retrieving the embed code for an environment, you can now flip a toggle switch to get the embed code if you want the library to load asynchronously.

#### Core Extension enhancements

The following have been added to the core extension:

* Random Number Data Element
* Page Info Data Element
* Date Condition
* Sampling Condition

#### User interface enhancements

* Information Videos on Empty List Pages
* Persistent filters

### Other changes

The following changes were made to be more descriptive of the actual behavior in sync and async scenarios:

* Page Top is now called Library Loaded
* On Load is now called Window Loaded

### Bug fixes and enhancements

* Fixed an issue where the Launch library would load twice in certain edge cases.
* There are now audit log entries for Property Delete.
* Improved the load speed of the Revision Selector when you quickly click from one entry to another.
* Help links now open in a new tab.

## Initial release

Release date: **November 8, 2017**

Important: Launch is being rolled out incrementally to Adobe Experience Cloud customers. If you have would like a chance to get early access, please put let us know by entering the required information in the Launch Release Form.

This is the first release of Launch.

Launch is the next-generation of tag management capabilities from Adobe. Launch gives customers a simple way to deploy and manage all of the analytics, marketing, and advertising tags necessary to power relevant customer experiences.

Launch empowers anyone to build and maintain their own integrations with Launch, called Extensions. These extensions are available to Launch customers in an app-store experience so they can quickly install, configure, and deploy their tags.

Launch enables you to:

Launch is offered to Adobe Marketing Cloud customers as an included, value-add feature. Launch is an entirely new product with a new code base, designed to replace the previous Dynamic Tag Management \(DTM\) service. However, DTM will continue to be supported for the foreseeable future. Adobe will continue to fix any significant bugs and ensure consistent performance. At this time, no major feature enhancements are planned for legacy DTM.

### Key benefits

* Faster time to value
* Trustworthy data through centralized collection, organization, and delivery using data elements
* Compelling experiences through the integration of data and marketing technology using rule builder

### Key features

#### Extensions

An extension is a package of code \(JavaScript, HTML, and CSS\) that extends the Launch UI and client functionality. ​Build, manage, and update your integrations using a virtually self-service interface. You can think of Launch as an operating system, and extensions are the apps you use to achieve your tasks.

#### Extension Catalog

Browse, configure, and deploy marketing/advertising tools built and maintained by independent software vendors.

#### Rule Builder

Create robust rules that combine multiple events, sequenced in the way that you determine using if/then logic with conditions and exceptions. Extensions provide options for:

* Events
* Conditions
* Exceptions
* Actions

The rule builder includes real-time error checking and syntax highlighting for your custom code.

When the criteria outlined in your rules are met and conditions are satisfied, the actions you define are executed in order.

#### Data Elements

Collect, organize, and deliver data across web-based marketing and advertising technology.

#### Enterprise Publishing

The publishing process enables teams to publish code to pages. Different people can create an implementation, approve it, and publish it to your pages.

* Changes to your code are encapsulated within libraries you define ​
* You specify where and when you want your code deployed ​
* Multiple libraries can be built in parallel by different teams ​
* Unlimited development environments ​
* Deliberate, permissioned process for merging libraries together ​

#### Open APIs

Automate implementations of individual technologies, or a group of technologies.

* Launch interacts with the Reactor APIs ​
* Deployments can be automated through APIs ​
* Integrate the Launch APIs with your own internal systems ​
* You can build your own user interface, if desired ​

#### Light, Modular Container tag

The Launch container tag is 60% lighter than Adobe Tag Manager and 40% lighter than Google Tag Manager. The content of your container is minified, including your custom code. Everything is modular. If you don't need an item, it is not included in your library. The result is an implementation that is fast and compact.

## Other highlights

Launch provides several improvements over similar systems, including:

* No use of `document.write ()` where Chrome doesn't allow it ​
* The Page Top and Page Bottom rules are bundled into the main library to minimize unnecessary HTTP calls ​ ​
* Custom action scripts within a rule can be loaded in parallel, but are executed sequentially ​
* If you avoid Page Top and Page Bottom rules, the code is mostly asynchronous, with a path to getting fully async ​
