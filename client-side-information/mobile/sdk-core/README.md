# Mobile Core

**Important**: Adobe Mobile Core is installed by default. 

## Configuring the Mobile Core Extension in Adobe Launch

1. On the Extensions page, click **Catalog**.
2. Click the up or down arrows to set a session timeout value. This is the period, in seconds, that must pass after a user backgrounds the app, but before the app is launched again and can be considered a new Lifecycle session.
3. Click **Save**.
