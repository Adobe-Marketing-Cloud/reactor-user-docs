# Builds

A build is the set of files that contains all the code that runs on your website. It is a composite of the changes you specified in a library and everything that has been submitted, approved, or published before it.

The build consists of one or more JavaScript files that reference each other. These files are delivered to your hosting location using the environment and adapter that you have chosen for the library. The embed code that you deploy on your site points to this same location so the files can load in a browser when a user accesses your site.

For mobile extensions, the configuration for the build is pushed together in the JSON file.
