# Adapters

Extensions, rules, and data elements are building blocks. When you want to make your application do something, these building blocks are added to libraries and then a library is "built" into a build. Those builds are delivered to a hosted location.

Adapters define available destinations where the builds can be delivered. For mobile extensions, the **Managed by Adobe** adapter is selected by default. 

The same adapter can be used for multiple environments in a property.

When you create a new property through the Launch UI, a default adapter of this type is created for you.
