# Environments

Extensions, rules, and data elements are building blocks. When you want to make your application do something, these building blocks are added to libraries and then a library is "built" into a build.

**Tip**: When you create a library, you must assign it to an environment. 

New properties are created with the following environments: 

* Development
* Staging
* Production

This is enough to run the publishing workflow. You might want to add additional Development environments. This is most common on larger teams with multiple developers working on different projects at the same time.

For mobile extensions, although the Dev, Stage, and Prod environments are created automatically, you can only create multiple Dev environments. 

After the environments are created, you are ready to publish.

## Create an Environment

1. Open the **Environments** tab.
2. Click **Create New Environment**.
3. Select your adapter.
4. Click **Save**.
5. Repeat for each environment in your development, approval, and publishing change.
