# Administration

This section contains information that is useful for Launch administrators.

* [**User Management**](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/reactor-user-docs/tree/67a59a7519514467a713016adfe46d999fe330d8/administration/user-management.md)

  This topic describes the user management process and available rights.

* [**Companies and Properties**](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/reactor-user-docs/tree/67a59a7519514467a713016adfe46d999fe330d8/administration/properties.md)

  A property, or web property, is a collection of rules, data elements, configured extensions, environments, and libraries. There is only one publish embed code per property.

* [**Adapter**](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/reactor-user-docs/tree/67a59a7519514467a713016adfe46d999fe330d8/administration/adapter.md)

  When you create a build, Launch delivers that build to a location determined by the adapter assigned to the environment.

* [**Environment**](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/reactor-user-docs/tree/67a59a7519514467a713016adfe46d999fe330d8/administration/environment-overview.md)

  An _environment_ is a destination for deployment. An environment has a 1:1 relationship with an embed code.

* [**Link DTM Embed Code to Launch**](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/reactor-user-docs/tree/67a59a7519514467a713016adfe46d999fe330d8/administration/embed-code-link.md)

  When you link your DTM embed code to Launch, you can keep your DTM production embed code on a page, but serve Launch files there instead of DTM.
