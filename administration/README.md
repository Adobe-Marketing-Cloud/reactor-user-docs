# Administration

This section contains information that is useful for Launch administrators.

* [**Users**](user-permissions.md)

  This topic describes the user management process and available rights.

* [**Companies and Properties**](companies-and-properties.md)

  A property, or web property, is a collection of rules, data elements, configured extensions, environments, and libraries. There is only one publish embed code per property.

* [**Adapter**](../publishing/web/adapters.md)

  When you create a build, Launch delivers that build to a location determined by the adapter assigned to the environment.

* [**Environment**](../publishing/web/environments.md)

  An _environment_ is a destination for deployment. An environment has a 1:1 relationship with an embed code.
