# Link DTM Embed Code

Linking embed codes primarily applies to DTM and Launch users who use built-in Akamai hosting. Those who are self-hosting, please see the [self-hosting section](link-dtm-embed-code.md#self-hosting) at the end of this article.

## Embed Code {#embed-code}

A DTM embed code is a `<script>` tag that you embed in the HTML of your web page.

This `<script>` tag retrieves a JavaScript file published by DTM and loads it on the page. This file is the DTM library file, commonly called a container tag. This container tag contains all the tools, data element definitions, rules logic, and code that you define inside of DTM.

DTM publishes this container tag file to the web host you specified, which is either an Akamai location or your own FTP location. The embed code that DTM provides is based on this host location.

When a user visits your site in a browser, the browser requests the DTM file from this server, using the embed code, and loads it.

In the diagram below, Step 1 shows DTM publishing the container tag to your specified web host. In Step 2, the browser requests the container tag, using the embed code, and the host responds with the published file.

## Linking Embed Codes {#linking-embed-codes}

The linking process allows you to take the DTM Production embed code, with its matching host location, and use that same embed code with your Launch production environment.

If you do this, DTM and Launch share the server location and the container tag file name.

When you publish in Launch, the Launch container tag file overwrites the DTM file, so when the browser requests the file from the server, the Launch file is returned.

In the diagram below, Step 3 represents Launch publishing its container tag over the top of the DTM container tag \(from Step 1\). When Step 2 occurs, it gets the Launch container tag instead.

**Important:** This overwriting works both ways. If you publish Launch, then subsequently publish from DTM, the DTM container tag overwrites the Launch one. You have two systems publishing to the same location. This means you don't have to change the code on your page, but it also means you need to be careful when you publish. It's recommended that you disable your DTM property to prevent this situation.

## Linking Prerequisites {#linking-prerequisites}

Before you link your embed code:

* Your DTM company must be connected to the same Experience Cloud Organization as Launch.
* Your user account must have the Manage Environments right in Launch and the Admin right in DTM.
* Your DTM property must not already be linked to a different Launch property.

## How to Link the Embed Code {#how-to-link-the-embed-code}

1. In Launch, open the Environments tab.
2. Create a new Production environment.
3. Give your environment a name.
4. Toggle the **Link DTM embed code** option on.
5. Paste your DTM production embed code into the **DTM Embed Code** field in Launch.
6. Finish configuring your Launch Production environment \(archive setup, etc\).
7. Click Save.

Launch validates a number of things and tells you whether linking was successful.

**Important:** You can only have one Production environment in Launch. If you have already created one on this property, you need to delete the existing Production environment so you can create a new linked environment. The new one does not have the same embed code as the old one, so don't do this unless you are familiar with the process.

## Recommended Test Process {#recommended-test-process}

If you use embed code linking, the process is mostly the same as without it, but with some highlighted differences:

1. Create your property, install an extension, create data elements, and create rules in Launch, as you normally would.
2. Create your Development and Staging environments in Launch as usual.
3. â€‹Create a linked Production environment as described above.
4. Create your library in Launch as usual.
5. Test in Development, submit, test in Staging, and approve as usual.
6. Publish. The Launch container tag overwrites the DTM container tag and any browser with this embed code retrieves the Launch container tag.
7. Disable your DTM property to prevent accidentally publishing the DTM file over the top of the Launch file.

Step 7 can be done any time after Step 3 has been performed.

## Self-hosting {#self-hosting}

DTM also supports self-hosting of the DTM container tag file. There are two methods to accomplish this:

* FTP Delivery
* Library Download

In either case, it doesn't make much sense to migrate the embed code. Nothing will break if you try it. It's recommended that you not use this option and set up your adapters and environments manually.

### FTP Delivery {#ftp-delivery}

Due to the differences in setup between FTP and SFTP,  DTM and Launch cannot perform automated migrations of these settings.

If you are using this method for delivery of the container tag, it's recommended that you move to SFTP in Launch. You can create an [SFTP adapter](../publishing/adapters.md#self-managed-adapter) and use this for any environment that you choose.

### Library Download {#library-download}

In Launch, downloading the library no longer exists as a separate option. If you use a library download in DTM, we recommend you skip the embed code migration and set up your Production environment with an Adobe Managed adapter and Archive enabled.

You can continue to use the same embed code that you use with DTM, but you are responsible for moving the library to your own servers with the correct file name.
