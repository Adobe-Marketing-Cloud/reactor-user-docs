# Implement Solutions

These implementation tutorials guide you through the steps required to implement the [Experience Cloud ID Service](https://marketing.adobe.com/resources/help/en_US/mcvid/). The ID Service sets a common visitor ID across all Adobe solutions in order to power Experience Cloud capabilities such as audience-sharing between solutions. You can also send your own customer IDs to the Service to enable additional integrations with your Customer Relationship Management \(CRM\) systems.

Solutions are implemented using Launch extensions. Extensions are one of the core features of Launch. An extension is an integration built by Adobe, an Adobe partner, or any Adobe customer that adds new and endless options for the tags that you can deploy to your website. If you think of Launch as an operating system, extensions are the apps that you install so Launch can do the things you need it to do.
